One popular option for implementing a free spell checker in a C# console application is to use the open-source library NHunspell. NHunspell is a .NET wrapper for Hunspell, the most widely used spellchecking engine. It provides excellent support for spell checking and is commonly used in C# applications.

Here's how you can use NHunspell in your C# console application:

1. **Install NHunspell via NuGet:**
   First, you need to install NHunspell via NuGet. You can do this either through Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager or by using the Package Manager Console with the following command:
   ```
   Install-Package NHunspell
   ```

2. **Download Dictionary Files:**
   NHunspell requires dictionary files for the language you want to check spelling for. You can download these dictionary files from various sources, including the LibreOffice repository or the official Hunspell repository.

3. **Run the Application:**
   Compile and run your C# console application. It will load the dictionary files and check the spelling of the words you provide.

NHunspell provides more advanced features such as adding custom dictionaries, checking compound words, and more. You can refer to the NHunspell documentation for further details and usage examples: https://github.com/hunspell/nhunspell
